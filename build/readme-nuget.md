## Contentment for Umbraco

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a state of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of [Umbraco](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UmbracoCms/) components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it.
No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/bytes.md) - a read-only label to display file sizes in relative bytes.
- [Code Editor](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/code-editor.md) - a code snippet editor, _(using the ACE library that is bundled with Umbraco)._

- [Data List](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/data-list.md) - an editor that combines a custom data source with a custom list editor.
- [Editor Notes](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/editor-notes.md) - Similar to [Notes](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/notes.md), with enhanced UI options.

#### Telemetry

Information about the [telemetry feature](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/telemetry.md).


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/) - can be found in the `/docs` folder.

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that have not yet been documented.<br>
_Let's call those "life's little surprises"._


### Roadmap

If you would like to know what is coming up in future releases, then take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/.github/ROADMAP.md).


### Support

I've been doing open source for a long time. I have suffered my fair share of burnout and empathy fatigue.

I reserve the right to address bug reports or feature requests in my own time, or ignore them completely.

**Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.** But please keep in mind, I am not your personal support developer.

If you are really stuck, do remember that the Umbraco community is amongst the friendliest on our planet, learn to embrace it. 
Ask for help on the [Our Umbraco support forum](https://our.umbraco.com/), I am sure someone can help you there.
